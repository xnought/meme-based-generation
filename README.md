# meme-based-generation

Language models probably can't generate new concepts or ideas outside of a certain limited distribution (at the moment).

One such way to tackle this issue is to take a page from humans.

## Memes!

Unlike evolution of genes, human culture appears to move much faster in progress. (e.g., language development).

These atomic units of memes (or concepts) can be varied and transimitted from human to human. Bad memes are less numeruous and good memes are more numeruous and continue to propgate.

Humans can simply be thought of as the vehicle here.

## New concepts

To quickly generate new ideas, you could simulate a population of people and release ideas that can be varied and transmitted or not. More numeruous concepst harbored by more of the people will be thought of as the good and new ideas.

Just replace people with language model and you have a start here. There needs to be more here, but this is a start.
